Building client
---------------
This project requires libfuse-dev, pkg-config, and curl to be  
installed on the system. In addition, python3 and stagger (from 
pip) are required to run the performance scripts.

Run ./install-deps.sh to install all of these dependencies.
Then, change the SERVER_ADDRESS macro at the top of cache_manager.c to 
point to the URI of the backing server (explained below).

Then, run make to build.

Running server
--------------
In the server directory, configure server settings by editing config.json.
Then, run the server: python3 server.py

The server will default to running on localhost on port 9880. 
The SERVER_ADDRESS variable to configure on the client will then be of the 
form: http://<server_ip_or_hostname>:9880/ 

Running client
--------------
Run ./yourtuneslib <mountpoint>, where <mountpoint> is the path to 
an existing directory to mount the filesystem to.

The server must be running at time of mount.
