Building client
---------------
This project requires libfuse-dev, pkg-config, mp3info, curl, and jq 
to be installed on the system. In addition, python3 and stagger 
(from pip) are required to run the performance scripts.

Run ./install-deps.sh to install all of these dependencies.
Then, run make to build.

Running server
--------------
In the server directory, configure server settings by editing config.json.
Then, run the server: python3 server.py

Running client
--------------
Run ./yourtuneslib <mountpoint>, where <mountpoint> is the path to 
an existing directory to mount the filesystem to.

The server must be running at time of mount.
